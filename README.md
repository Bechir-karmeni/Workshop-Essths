Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project is an interactive application for recognizing handwritten digits using a deep learning model. The system is built using Python, Pygame for drawing, OpenCV for image processing, and Keras for model inference.



## Features

- Interactive digit drawing interface using Pygame.

- Deep learning-based digit recognition using a pre-trained model.

- Real-time prediction and display of recognized digits.

- Clear and quit functionalities for user convenience.


## Installation

Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bechir-karmeni/Workshop-Essths.git
cd Workshop-Essths
```

Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


    
    
    
## Usage/Examples
To run the application, execute:
```python
python main.py
```

## Controls

- Draw: Use the mouse to draw digits in the designated area.

- Predict: Release the mouse to recognize the digit.


- Clear Screen: Press 'C' to clear the screen.


- Quit: Press 'Q' to exit the application.

## Model


The deep learning model is trained on the MNIST dataset and saved as bestmodel.h5. The model is loaded at runtime to predict user-drawn digits.
